      description <<~TEXT
      A hidden ordering represents an ordering that should not be shown in the frontend,
      when iterating over an entity's available orderings. It does not affect access, as
      hidden orderings may still serve a functional purpose for their schema.

      Configuration for how to render an ordering and its entries.

    field :tree, Boolean, null: false, method: :tree_mode? do
      description <<~TEXT
      A tree ordering has some special handling to return entities
      in deterministic order based on their hierarchical position
      and relation to other entities in the same ordering.

      This is effectively a shortcut for `Ordering.render.mode === "TREE"`.
