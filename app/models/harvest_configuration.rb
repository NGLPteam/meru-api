# frozen_string_literal: true

# This record functions as a sort of mobile duplicate of {HarvestAttempt}.
#
# It provides a persistent configuration for {HarvestRecord} to grok how
# it should harvest itself, without being tied directly to a specific
# {HarvestAttempt}, since records can be touched by many attempts at a time.
# The latest attempt will store its associated configuration on any
# harvest record it comes across.
#
# The main purpose of this is to allow attempts to be purged without losing
# knowledge of how records should be harvested, and maintaining ties to
# specific {HarvestMapping} and {HarvestSet} records, where applicable.
