# One of the slowest parts of harvesting is fetching cached assets. Often, these
# URLs are unique and don't change often, and it causes reharvesting to be a much
# lengthier process than necessary. It also produces issues when asset URLs are
# unreliable or resource-limited.
#
# We separate the asset extraction to a separate step that enables an entity to
# enter into the system much faster, possibly missing its assets, as well as
# cache asset retrieval across harvesting attempts to speed up reharvesting.
