Description:
    Generate a GraphQL mutation, support files, and test spec and then
    register it into the system.

Example:
    bin/rails generate mutation SomeMutation

    This will create:
        app/graphql/mutations/some_mutation.rb
        app/operations/mutations/contracts/some_mutation.rb
        app/operations/mutations/operations/some_mutation.rb
        spec/requests/graphql/mutations/some_mutation_spec.rb

    It will also add an entry for the mutation to:
        app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb
