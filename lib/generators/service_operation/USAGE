Description:
    Create a service and operation pair using conventions.

    The operation class will be a SimpleServiceOperation that
    simply passes all arguments passed to `#call` on to the
    initializer for the service.

    The service will inherit from `Support::HookBased::Actor`
    and use `standard_execution!`, with a `prepare!` hook and
    its dry-initializer block prepopulated to save time.

Example:
    bin/rails generate service_operation Some::Namespace Create Creator

    This will create:
        app/operations/some/namespace/create.rb
        app/services/some/namespace/creator.rb
