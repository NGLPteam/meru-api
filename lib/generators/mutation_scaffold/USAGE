Description:
    Generate create, update, and destroy mutations and test specs for a given model,
    registering each into the system.

Example:
    bin/rails generate mutation_scaffold Model

    This will create:
        app/graphql/mutations/create_model.rb
        app/graphql/mutations/destroy_model.rb
        app/graphql/mutations/update_model.rb
        app/operations/mutations/contracts/create_model.rb
        app/operations/mutations/contracts/destroy_model.rb
        app/operations/mutations/contracts/update_model.rb
        app/operations/mutations/operations/create_model.rb
        app/operations/mutations/operations/destroy_model.rb
        app/operations/mutations/operations/update_model.rb
        spec/requests/graphql/mutations/create_model_spec.rb
        spec/requests/graphql/mutations/destroy_model_spec.rb
        spec/requests/graphql/mutations/update_model_spec.rb

    It will also add entries for each mutation to:
        app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb
