# This namespace supports {Mutations} with a number of services
# and interfaces that provide standardized lifecycle and error
# handling infrastructure to the execution of a GraphQL mutation.
#
# The logic that implements individual mutations is found in the
# similarly-named {Mutations::Operations} namespace. The mutation
# fields and argument declarations can be found as subclasses
# {Mutations::BaseMutation of the base mutation}.
