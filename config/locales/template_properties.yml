  template_properties:
    _common:
      background:
        description: |
          The background gradient to use for this template. Affects presentation.
      dynamic_ordering_definition:
        description: |
          When `selectionMode` is set to `DYNAMIC`, this uses the same basic structure
          as schemas to define a dynamic ordering that is resolved at runtime and based
          on the `selectionSource`.
      manual_list_name:
        description: |
          When `selectionMode` is set to `MANUAL`, the purpose of this property
          is to specify a name under which all the manual selections (per entity)
          will be stored. This allows a layout to have multiple templates of the
          same type using different lists, that will persist across rearrangements
          of the layout _without_ losing connections between entities.
      selection_limit:
        description: |
          Regardless of `selectionMode`, this limit will be applied on whatever resulting
          list of entities are produced, so that only up to that amount of entities are
          rendered in the template proper.
      selection_source:
        description: |
          When selecting entities based on `selectionMode`, this property determines
          which entity (relevant to the rendering entity) should be used for lookups.

          By default, it is `self`, which means the rendering entity itself.

          It can also support things like `ancestor.journal`, `ancestor.issue`, etc.,
          in order to render a list of values in its parent.
      selection_source_mode:
        description: |
          An enum representing what mode `selectionSource` is in. Not directly set,
          it is used internally for lookups.
      selection_property_path:
        description: |
          When `selectionMode` is set to `PROPERTY`, this should be set to the full path
          for a given schema property on the associated `selectionSource`
      variant:
        description: |
          The variant rendering mode to use for this template. Affects presentation.
    contributor_list:
      limit:
        description: |
          Limit the number of contributors for this template.
    descendant_list:
      ordering_identifier:
        description: |
          When `selectionMode` is set to `NAMED`, this will look up the named ordering
          on the resolved `selectionSource` and render up to `selectionLimit` entities.
    detail:
      show_body:
        description: |
          Whether to show and use the 'body' slot on a detail view.
          Primarily intended for items with copious text to display.
    ordering:
      ordering_identifier:
        description: |
          The identifier for the ordering to derive next/prev siblings from.

          Refer to `orderingSource` and `selectionSource` for more details.
      ordering_source:
        description: |
          A reference to the entity that contains an ordering identified by `orderingIdentifier`.
          It operates exactly like `selectionSource`. See that property for more documentation.

          **Note**: While `self` is allowed here, it only makes sense if the rendering entity
          is contained in one of its own orderings, which doesn't happen normally. The template
          will still render, but it likely won't find siblings.
      selection_source:
        description: |
          What entity to use for detecting the positional prev/next siblings.

          By default, it is `self`. However, it can be overridden for creating templates that
          navigate through parent issues, volumes, journals, etc. For instance, an article could
          create an `<ordering />` template that has the following properties set:

          * `selectionSource`: `"ancestors.issue"`
          * `orderingSource`: `"ancestors.journal"`
          * `orderingIdentifier`: `"issues"`

          This would use the _journal's_ `issues` ordering to navigate through the article's
          associated `issues`, and provide a quick way to navigate through varying levels of
          the upper hierarchy from lower points in the tree.
