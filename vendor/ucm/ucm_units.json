Our common purpose is to collaborate on\n            the study of minority discourse across national boundaries (transnational) with\n            attention to colonial and neocolonial processes (transcolonial). Our immediate research\n            goal is to publish a series of books that will reformulate minority discourse from a\n            comparative perspective informed by a consideration of transnational and transcolonial\n            processes (see the definitions of these terms in \"Research Program Description\" on our\n            website). The core group of 43 members: meets regularly and holds workshops and\n            conferences; mentors graduate students with an aim to help publish their work; invites\n            outside speakers (nationally and internationally known scholars in minority discourse as\n            well as minority cultural producers such as artists and writers) to enrich our\n            comparative approach; and finally, aids in pedagogical transformations in high schools\n            and universities so as to encourage curricular changes that reflect the demographic\n            diversity in California. Ultimately, our institutional goal is to create a Center for\n            Transnational and Transcolonial Studies that provides linages among area studies and\n            ethnic studies centers, as well as humanities and social science departments where the\n            focus is often predominantly mainstream (majority discourse) or bounded by one\n            discipline, one nation, one culture, or one language. The Center will organize research\n            and publication, promote pedagogical development, and coordinate related research\n            efforts at the University of California.</p>",

It expands upon the existing Institutes of Industrial\n            Relations (IIRs) at UC Berkeley and UCLA, which were founded in 1945, and on the two\n            Centers for Labor Research and Education housed in the IIRs on those two campuses. The\n            ILE itself is based at UCLA and UC Berkeley, but draws on and supports faculty, academic\n            staff, and students throughout all the campuses in the UC system, sponsoring a variety\n            of employment-related research and service activities.</p>",

To carry out its mission, the UC LMRI funded research of UC faculty and graduate students; provided professional development for researchers, educators, and policymakers; and disseminated information to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers on educational issues affecting linguistic minorities as well as racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants for both California and the nation. </p>\n<p> As a part of its dissemination activities it sponsored an annual research conference that drew participants from across the nation, and conducted regular policy seminars in the state capitol to inform policymakers on the latest research relevant to pending policy issues. The policy seminars became a notable fixture in the capitol. UC LMRI produced dozens of reports, several books, and was the catalyst for numerous journal articles during its existence. It was the \u201cgo to\u201d research center on issues of English language learners for both researchers and practitioners nationwide. Some of the most consulted publications produced over the years are available here at the Civil Rights Project website. </p>\n<p>  The UC LMRI closed its doors in 2009 after 25 years of existence. In order to make its documents available, LMRI documents are housed here.</p>",

        "html": "Interdisciplinary graduate study in World Cultures focuses on the ways in which human beings conceive, express, and enact their situations in and relations to societies from the local to the global. In this endeavor, the World Cultures Graduate Group simultaneously embraces emerging trends in the scholarly world, while it harkens back to the holistic approach to knowledge common in the Renaissance. The interdisciplinary framework reconnects areas of study that have drifted apart even as their critical structures have shared basic tools and areas of inquiry\u2014fields ranging from history and literature to art, anthropology, philosophy, and religion. Students will understand and use methods by which historians, literary scholars, anthropologists, artists, philosophers, and other humanists and social scientists examine societies and cultures. At the same time, students will critically examine theories of identity, culture, and society shared by scholars in multiple academic fields that create intellectual bridges for interdisciplinary inquiry. The World Cultures Graduate Group thus provides a broad intellectual context in which to locate societies and cultures over time and space. The objective is to train scholars who are able to work within or beyond the academy in particular disciplines and, simultaneously, to acknowledge and create interdisciplinary frameworks for study of complex human systems and constructs."

The conference will explore constructed worlds in all their visual manifestations and encourages submissions that deal with the idea of a world that is not preexisting and fixed, but constructed, or in the process of creation. This idea of a world is exceedingly supple and open to numerous complex interpretations. A world can be both tactile and virtual, exterior and interior. It can be ancient, contemporary and everything in between. Technology, language, diaspora and migration, global economics, political discourses, and other phenomena contain the power to not only construct new worlds, but also to redefine and destroy existing worlds. With these ideas in mind, we seek papers that highlight not only the generation of worlds, but also their delineation within society. We welcome papers that discuss how ideology implements and transforms the process of world making or world breaking, provoking new methods of communication and cultural interaction.</p>\n<p>Topics for discussion could include, but are not limited to: </p><ul>\n<li>Trans-border Literature</li>\n<li>Urban Studies</li>\n<li>Digital humanities</li>\n<li>World Heritage</li>\n<li>Digital heritage</li>\n<li>Material culture studies</li>\n<li>Post(de) colonial Identities</li>\n<li>Glocal production</li>\n</ul><p></p>"

        "html": "<p>Founded in 1968, the UCEAP M\u00e9xico program is located in a country contiguous with the United States, which lends the program a very special character. Relations between M\u00e9xico and and United States\u2014and with border states like California in particular\u2014are intimate, complex, rich and contested, and they affect every aspect of life on both sides of the border. Study in M\u00e9xico consequently offers unparalleled opportunities for UC students to reach new understandings of what it means to be a Californian, a citizen of the United States, and a citizen of a rapidly globalizing society.</p>\n<p>UCEAP M\u00e9xico students are often drawn to address the most sensitive and urgent aspects of Mexican society and culture in their work. This can be a challenging, even transformative process. UCEAP M\u00e9xico\u2019s academic programs are designed to help students undertake such projects with success, and the results have frequently been outstanding. We have founded this Working Paper Series in order to showcase the remarkable contributions that these young scholars are making to the ever-evolving transnational dialog between the two North American United States\u2014of America, and of M\u00e9xico.</p>\n<p>Recent work by UCEAP M\u00e9xico students has won the UCEAP Undergraduate Research Award, given for \"quality of research concept and execution, integral and innovative use of resources at the study site, quality of presentation, distinctiveness of the research, and quality of faculty support.\" (see <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/AboutUs/Pages/press_release_detail.aspx?nID=243\">http://eap.ucop.edu/AboutUs/Pages/press_release_detail.aspx?nID=243</a>)</p>\n<h3>PROGRAMS</h3>\n<p>There are two program options for UCEAP M\u00e9xico: study at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM), and the Field Research Program (FRP).</p>\n<h4>UNAM</h4>\n<p>(More information can be found at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/national_autonomous_univ_mexico.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/national_autonomous_univ_mexico.aspx</a>)</p>\n<p>The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) is the number one\u2013 ranked university in Latin America, recently awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in Communication and Humanities. It is also one of the world\u2019s largest public universities, with over 300,000 students enrolled and 35,000 professors and researchers on staff.</p>\n<p>During the first four weeks in Mexico City, in preparation for the beginning of the academic year in August, students take an intensive review of the Spanish language and Contemporary Mexico class that presents contemporary Mexican culture, society, and diversity, in addition to a historical perspective.</p>\n<p>At the UNAM, Students enroll full-time in regularly offered classes for a semester or for an entire year, making progress toward their UC degrees in a wide variety of fields.</p>\n<p>In addition, UCEAP M\u00e9xico coordinates and oversees the many opportunities for individual studies, internships, and volunteer work that are available to UNAM students in Mexico City.</p>\n<h4>FRP</h4>\n<p>(More information can be found at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx</a>)</p>\n<p>In the Field Research Program, students devote a semester to an independent research project.</p>\n<p>During the first five weeks in Mexico City, in addition to an intensive review of the Spanish language, students take an accelerated course in field research techniques and ethnography, as well as becoming familiar with local libraries, archives, and other research centers. In addition, a Contemporary Mexico class provides familiarity with major themes in Mexican history and scholarship. The intensity of this period is punctuated by roundtable discussions with the Mexican scholars who will become the mentors for the students\u2019 research projects, offering advance guidance on proposals and appropriate research sites. These scholars form part of the Editorial Board of our Working Papers Series.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the semester is dedicated to individual field research at one of a number of sites throughout the country (Currently available research sites and mentors are listed at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx</a>). Students meet with mentors at least once a week for academic advice and guidance.</p>\n<p>At the end of the program, students write up the results of their research in a substantial paper, which they also present in Mexico City for fellow program participants, instructors, and the Visiting Professor.</p>"

        "html": "<p>Founded in 1968, the UCEAP M\u00e9xico program is located in a country contiguous with the United States, which lends the program a very special character. Relations between M\u00e9xico and and United States\u2014and with border states like California in particular\u2014are intimate, complex, rich and contested, and they affect every aspect of life on both sides of the border. Study in M\u00e9xico consequently offers unparalleled opportunities for UC students to reach new understandings of what it means to be a Californian, a citizen of the United States, and a citizen of a rapidly globalizing society.</p>\n<p>UCEAP M\u00e9xico students are often drawn to address the most sensitive and urgent aspects of Mexican society and culture in their work. This can be a challenging, even transformative process. UCEAP M\u00e9xico\u2019s academic programs are designed to help students undertake such projects with success, and the results have frequently been outstanding. We have founded this Working Paper Series in order to showcase the remarkable contributions that these young scholars are making to the ever-evolving transnational dialog between the two North American United States\u2014of America, and of M\u00e9xico.</p>\n<p>Recent work by UCEAP M\u00e9xico students has won the UCEAP Undergraduate Research Award, given for \"quality of research concept and execution, integral and innovative use of resources at the study site, quality of presentation, distinctiveness of the research, and quality of faculty support.\" (see <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/AboutUs/Pages/press_release_detail.aspx?nID=243\">http://eap.ucop.edu/AboutUs/Pages/press_release_detail.aspx?nID=243</a>)</p>\n<h3>PROGRAMS</h3>\n<p>There are two program options for UCEAP M\u00e9xico: study at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM), and the Field Research Program (FRP).</p>\n<h4>UNAM</h4>\n<p>(More information can be found at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/national_autonomous_univ_mexico.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/national_autonomous_univ_mexico.aspx</a>)</p>\n<p>The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) is the number one\u2013 ranked university in Latin America, recently awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in Communication and Humanities. It is also one of the world\u2019s largest public universities, with over 300,000 students enrolled and 35,000 professors and researchers on staff.</p>\n<p>During the first four weeks in Mexico City, in preparation for the beginning of the academic year in August, students take an intensive review of the Spanish language and Contemporary Mexico class that presents contemporary Mexican culture, society, and diversity, in addition to a historical perspective.</p>\n<p>At the UNAM, Students enroll full-time in regularly offered classes for a semester or for an entire year, making progress toward their UC degrees in a wide variety of fields.</p>\n<p>In addition, UCEAP M\u00e9xico coordinates and oversees the many opportunities for individual studies, internships, and volunteer work that are available to UNAM students in Mexico City.</p>\n<h4>FRP</h4>\n<p>(More information can be found at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx</a>)</p>\n<p>In the Field Research Program, students devote a semester to an independent research project.</p>\n<p>During the first five weeks in Mexico City, in addition to an intensive review of the Spanish language, students take an accelerated course in field research techniques and ethnography, as well as becoming familiar with local libraries, archives, and other research centers. In addition, a Contemporary Mexico class provides familiarity with major themes in Mexican history and scholarship. The intensity of this period is punctuated by roundtable discussions with the Mexican scholars who will become the mentors for the students\u2019 research projects, offering advance guidance on proposals and appropriate research sites. These scholars form part of the Editorial Board of our Working Papers Series.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the semester is dedicated to individual field research at one of a number of sites throughout the country (Currently available research sites and mentors are listed at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx</a>). Students meet with mentors at least once a week for academic advice and guidance.</p>\n<p>At the end of the program, students write up the results of their research in a substantial paper, which they also present in Mexico City for fellow program participants, instructors, and the Visiting Professor.</p>"

Students review restoration plans and evaluate completed projects. In addition to lectures and discussions by the instructor, students, and an extraordinary set of guest lecturers drawn from the active restoration community, the principal course requirement is an independent term project involving original research. The term projects are peer-reviewed, revised, and ultimately added to the permanent collection of the UC Water Resources Collections and Archives, where they can be searched in the Scotty and Melvyl catalogs. Independent term projects are presented each year in a public symposium.</p>",

Our common purpose is to collaborate on\n            the study of minority discourse across national boundaries (transnational) with\n            attention to colonial and neocolonial processes (transcolonial). Our immediate research\n            goal is to publish a series of books that will reformulate minority discourse from a\n            comparative perspective informed by a consideration of transnational and transcolonial\n            processes (see the definitions of these terms in \"Research Program Description\" on our\n            website). The core group of 43 members: meets regularly and holds workshops and\n            conferences; mentors graduate students with an aim to help publish their work; invites\n            outside speakers (nationally and internationally known scholars in minority discourse as\n            well as minority cultural producers such as artists and writers) to enrich our\n            comparative approach; and finally, aids in pedagogical transformations in high schools\n            and universities so as to encourage curricular changes that reflect the demographic\n            diversity in California. Ultimately, our institutional goal is to create a Center for\n            Transnational and Transcolonial Studies that provides linages among area studies and\n            ethnic studies centers, as well as humanities and social science departments where the\n            focus is often predominantly mainstream (majority discourse) or bounded by one\n            discipline, one nation, one culture, or one language. The Center will organize research\n            and publication, promote pedagogical development, and coordinate related research\n            efforts at the University of California.</p>",

        "html": "Interdisciplinary graduate study in World Cultures focuses on the ways in which human beings conceive, express, and enact their situations in and relations to societies from the local to the global. In this endeavor, the World Cultures Graduate Group simultaneously embraces emerging trends in the scholarly world, while it harkens back to the holistic approach to knowledge common in the Renaissance. The interdisciplinary framework reconnects areas of study that have drifted apart even as their critical structures have shared basic tools and areas of inquiry\u2014fields ranging from history and literature to art, anthropology, philosophy, and religion. Students will understand and use methods by which historians, literary scholars, anthropologists, artists, philosophers, and other humanists and social scientists examine societies and cultures. At the same time, students will critically examine theories of identity, culture, and society shared by scholars in multiple academic fields that create intellectual bridges for interdisciplinary inquiry. The World Cultures Graduate Group thus provides a broad intellectual context in which to locate societies and cultures over time and space. The objective is to train scholars who are able to work within or beyond the academy in particular disciplines and, simultaneously, to acknowledge and create interdisciplinary frameworks for study of complex human systems and constructs."

The conference will explore constructed worlds in all their visual manifestations and encourages submissions that deal with the idea of a world that is not preexisting and fixed, but constructed, or in the process of creation. This idea of a world is exceedingly supple and open to numerous complex interpretations. A world can be both tactile and virtual, exterior and interior. It can be ancient, contemporary and everything in between. Technology, language, diaspora and migration, global economics, political discourses, and other phenomena contain the power to not only construct new worlds, but also to redefine and destroy existing worlds. With these ideas in mind, we seek papers that highlight not only the generation of worlds, but also their delineation within society. We welcome papers that discuss how ideology implements and transforms the process of world making or world breaking, provoking new methods of communication and cultural interaction.</p>\n<p>Topics for discussion could include, but are not limited to: </p><ul>\n<li>Trans-border Literature</li>\n<li>Urban Studies</li>\n<li>Digital humanities</li>\n<li>World Heritage</li>\n<li>Digital heritage</li>\n<li>Material culture studies</li>\n<li>Post(de) colonial Identities</li>\n<li>Glocal production</li>\n</ul><p></p>"

The conference will explore constructed worlds in all their visual manifestations and encourages submissions that deal with the idea of a world that is not preexisting and fixed, but constructed, or in the process of creation. This idea of a world is exceedingly supple and open to numerous complex interpretations. A world can be both tactile and virtual, exterior and interior. It can be ancient, contemporary and everything in between. Technology, language, diaspora and migration, global economics, political discourses, and other phenomena contain the power to not only construct new worlds, but also to redefine and destroy existing worlds. With these ideas in mind, we seek papers that highlight not only the generation of worlds, but also their delineation within society. We welcome papers that discuss how ideology implements and transforms the process of world making or world breaking, provoking new methods of communication and cultural interaction.</p>\n<p>Topics for discussion could include, but are not limited to: </p><ul>\n<li>Trans-border Literature</li>\n<li>Urban Studies</li>\n<li>Digital humanities</li>\n<li>World Heritage</li>\n<li>Digital heritage</li>\n<li>Material culture studies</li>\n<li>Post(de) colonial Identities</li>\n<li>Glocal production</li>\n</ul><p></p>"

Relations between M\u00e9xico and and United States\u2014and with border states like California in particular\u2014are intimate, complex, rich and contested, and they affect every aspect of life on both sides of the border. Study in M\u00e9xico consequently offers unparalleled opportunities for UC students to reach new understandings of what it means to be a Californian, a citizen of the United States, and a citizen of a rapidly globalizing society.</p>\n<p>UCEAP M\u00e9xico students are often drawn to address the most sensitive and urgent aspects of Mexican society and culture in their work. This can be a challenging, even transformative process. UCEAP M\u00e9xico\u2019s academic programs are designed to help students undertake such projects with success, and the results have frequently been outstanding. We have founded this Working Paper Series in order to showcase the remarkable contributions that these young scholars are making to the ever-evolving transnational dialog between the two North American United States\u2014of America, and of M\u00e9xico.</p>\n<p>Recent work by UCEAP M\u00e9xico students has won the UCEAP Undergraduate Research Award, given for \"quality of research concept and execution, integral and innovative use of resources at the study site, quality of presentation, distinctiveness of the research, and quality of faculty support.\" (see <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/AboutUs/Pages/press_release_detail.aspx?nID=243\">http://eap.ucop.edu/AboutUs/Pages/press_release_detail.aspx?nID=243</a>)</p>\n<h3>PROGRAMS</h3>\n<p>There are two program options for UCEAP M\u00e9xico: study at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM), and the Field Research Program (FRP).</p>\n<h4>UNAM</h4>\n<p>(More information can be found at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/national_autonomous_univ_mexico.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/national_autonomous_univ_mexico.aspx</a>)</p>\n<p>The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) is the number one\u2013 ranked university in Latin America, recently awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in Communication and Humanities. It is also one of the world\u2019s largest public universities, with over 300,000 students enrolled and 35,000 professors and researchers on staff.</p>\n<p>During the first four weeks in Mexico City, in preparation for the beginning of the academic year in August, students take an intensive review of the Spanish language and Contemporary Mexico class that presents contemporary Mexican culture, society, and diversity, in addition to a historical perspective.</p>\n<p>At the UNAM, Students enroll full-time in regularly offered classes for a semester or for an entire year, making progress toward their UC degrees in a wide variety of fields.</p>\n<p>In addition, UCEAP M\u00e9xico coordinates and oversees the many opportunities for individual studies, internships, and volunteer work that are available to UNAM students in Mexico City.</p>\n<h4>FRP</h4>\n<p>(More information can be found at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx</a>)</p>\n<p>In the Field Research Program, students devote a semester to an independent research project.</p>\n<p>During the first five weeks in Mexico City, in addition to an intensive review of the Spanish language, students take an accelerated course in field research techniques and ethnography, as well as becoming familiar with local libraries, archives, and other research centers. In addition, a Contemporary Mexico class provides familiarity with major themes in Mexican history and scholarship. The intensity of this period is punctuated by roundtable discussions with the Mexican scholars who will become the mentors for the students\u2019 research projects, offering advance guidance on proposals and appropriate research sites. These scholars form part of the Editorial Board of our Working Papers Series.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the semester is dedicated to individual field research at one of a number of sites throughout the country (Currently available research sites and mentors are listed at <a href=\"http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx\">http://eap.ucop.edu/guides/mexico/1314/Pages/field_research_uc_center_mexico_city.aspx</a>). Students meet with mentors at least once a week for academic advice and guidance.</p>\n<p>At the end of the program, students write up the results of their research in a substantial paper, which they also present in Mexico City for fellow program participants, instructors, and the Visiting Professor.</p>"

    "about": "<p>Taught since 1992 (the longest-running course devoted to river restoration at a major research university), this course emphasizes understanding of underlying goals and assumptions of restoration and integration of science into restoration planning and design. Students review restoration plans and evaluate completed projects. In addition to lectures and discussions by the instructor, students, and an extraordinary set of guest lecturers drawn from the active restoration community, the principal course requirement is an independent term project involving original research. The term projects are peer-reviewed, revised, and ultimately added to the permanent collection of the UC Water Resources Collections and Archives, where they can be searched in the Scotty and Melvyl catalogs. Independent term projects are presented each year in a public symposium.</p>",

    "about": "<p>Taught since 1992 (the longest-running course devoted to river restoration at a major research university), this course emphasizes understanding of underlying goals and assumptions of restoration and integration of science into restoration planning and design. Students review restoration plans and evaluate completed projects. In addition to lectures and discussions by the instructor, students, and an extraordinary set of guest lecturers drawn from the active restoration community, the principal course requirement is an independent term project involving original research. The term projects are peer-reviewed, revised, and ultimately added to the permanent collection of the UC Water Resources Collections and Archives, where they can be searched in the Scotty and Melvyl catalogs. Independent term projects are presented each year in a public symposium.</p>",

The conference will explore constructed worlds in all their visual manifestations and encourages submissions that deal with the idea of a world that is not preexisting and fixed, but constructed, or in the process of creation. This idea of a world is exceedingly supple and open to numerous complex interpretations. A world can be both tactile and virtual, exterior and interior. It can be ancient, contemporary and everything in between. Technology, language, diaspora and migration, global economics, political discourses, and other phenomena contain the power to not only construct new worlds, but also to redefine and destroy existing worlds. With these ideas in mind, we seek papers that highlight not only the generation of worlds, but also their delineation within society. We welcome papers that discuss how ideology implements and transforms the process of world making or world breaking, provoking new methods of communication and cultural interaction.</p>\n<p>Topics for discussion could include, but are not limited to: </p><ul>\n<li>Trans-border Literature</li>\n<li>Urban Studies</li>\n<li>Digital humanities</li>\n<li>World Heritage</li>\n<li>Digital heritage</li>\n<li>Material culture studies</li>\n<li>Post(de) colonial Identities</li>\n<li>Glocal production</li>\n</ul><p></p>"

    "about": "<p>Taught since 1992 (the longest-running course devoted to river restoration at a major research university), this course emphasizes understanding of underlying goals and assumptions of restoration and integration of science into restoration planning and design. Students review restoration plans and evaluate completed projects. In addition to lectures and discussions by the instructor, students, and an extraordinary set of guest lecturers drawn from the active restoration community, the principal course requirement is an independent term project involving original research. The term projects are peer-reviewed, revised, and ultimately added to the permanent collection of the UC Water Resources Collections and Archives, where they can be searched in the Scotty and Melvyl catalogs. Independent term projects are presented each year in a public symposium.</p>",
