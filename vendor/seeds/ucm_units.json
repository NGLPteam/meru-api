Our immediate research\n            goal is to publish a series of books that will reformulate minority discourse from a\n            comparative perspective informed by a consideration of transnational and transcolonial\n            processes (see the definitions of these terms in \"Research Program Description\" on our\n            website). The core group of 43 members: meets regularly and holds workshops and\n            conferences; mentors graduate students with an aim to help publish their work; invites\n            outside speakers (nationally and internationally known scholars in minority discourse as\n            well as minority cultural producers such as artists and writers) to enrich our\n            comparative approach; and finally, aids in pedagogical transformations in high schools\n            and universities so as to encourage curricular changes that reflect the demographic\n            diversity in California.

            "about": "<p><a href=\"http://escholarship.org/uc/lmri\">The University of California Linguistic Minority Research Institute</a> (UC LMRI) was established in 1984 in response to the California Legislature's request that the University of California's Office of the President (UCOP) pursue \"...knowledge applicable to educational policy and practice in the area of language minority students' academic achievement and knowledge,\" including their access to the University of California and other institutions of higher education.</p>\n<p>The UC LMRI was first established as a research project and then became a Multi-campus Research Unit (MRU) in 1992, with representatives from each of the UC campuses serving as its board. To carry out its mission, the UC LMRI funded research of UC faculty and graduate students; provided professional development for researchers, educators, and policymakers; and disseminated information to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers on educational issues affecting linguistic minorities as well as racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants for both California and the nation. </p>\n<p> As a part of its dissemination activities it sponsored an annual research conference that drew participants from across the nation, and conducted regular policy seminars in the state capitol to inform policymakers on the latest research relevant to pending policy issues. The policy seminars became a notable fixture in the capitol. UC LMRI produced dozens of reports, several books, and was the catalyst for numerous journal articles during its existence. It was the \u201cgo to\u201d research center on issues of English language learners for both researchers and practitioners nationwide. Some of the most consulted publications produced over the years are available here at the Civil Rights Project website. </p>\n<p>  The UC LMRI closed its doors in 2009 after 25 years of existence.

In this endeavor, the World Cultures Graduate Group simultaneously embraces emerging trends in the scholarly world, while it harkens back to the holistic approach to knowledge common in the Renaissance. The interdisciplinary framework reconnects areas of study that have drifted apart even as their critical structures have shared basic tools and areas of inquiry\u2014fields ranging from history and literature to art, anthropology, philosophy, and religion. Students will understand and use methods by which historians, literary scholars, anthropologists, artists, philosophers, and other humanists and social scientists examine societies and cultures. At the same time, students will critically examine theories of identity, culture, and society shared by scholars in multiple academic fields that create intellectual bridges for interdisciplinary inquiry. The World Cultures Graduate Group thus provides a broad intellectual context in which to locate societies and cultures over time and space. The objective is to train scholars who are able to work within or beyond the academy in particular disciplines and, simultaneously, to acknowledge and create interdisciplinary frameworks for study of complex human systems and constructs."

The conference will explore constructed worlds in all their visual manifestations and encourages submissions that deal with the idea of a world that is not preexisting and fixed, but constructed, or in the process of creation. This idea of a world is exceedingly supple and open to numerous complex interpretations. A world can be both tactile and virtual, exterior and interior. It can be ancient, contemporary and everything in between. Technology, language, diaspora and migration, global economics, political discourses, and other phenomena contain the power to not only construct new worlds, but also to redefine and destroy existing worlds. With these ideas in mind, we seek papers that highlight not only the generation of worlds, but also their delineation within society. We welcome papers that discuss how ideology implements and transforms the process of world making or world breaking, provoking new methods of communication and cultural interaction.</p>\n<p>Topics for discussion could include, but are not limited to: </p><ul>\n<li>Trans-border Literature</li>\n<li>Urban Studies</li>\n<li>Digital humanities</li>\n<li>World Heritage</li>\n<li>Digital heritage</li>\n<li>Material culture studies</li>\n<li>Post(de) colonial Identities</li>\n<li>Glocal production</li>\n</ul><p></p>"

Relations between M\u00e9xico and and United States\u2014and with border states like California in particular\u2014are intimate, complex, rich and contested, and they affect every aspect of life on both sides of the border. Study in M\u00e9xico consequently offers unparalleled opportunities for UC students to reach new understandings of what it means to be a Californian, a citizen of the United States, and a citizen of a rapidly globalizing society.</p>\n<p>UCEAP M\u00e9xico students are often drawn to address the most sensitive and urgent aspects of Mexican society and culture in their work. This can be a challenging, even transformative process. UCEAP M\u00e9xico\u2019s academic programs are designed to help students undertake such projects with success, and the results have frequently been outstanding.

The term projects are peer-reviewed, revised, and ultimately added to the permanent collection of the UC Water Resources Collections and Archives, where they can be searched in the Scotty and Melvyl catalogs.

UC\n      Berkeley coastal engineers and professors Morrough P. O'Brien and Joe W. Johnson are primarily\n      responsible for establishing the Archives on the Berkeley campus. The Archives focuses on\n      collecting material pertinent to California and the West. The collection consists of over\n      135,000 technical reports, 1,500 specialized newsletters, 5,000 maps and videos. Many of these\n      materials are unique and cannot be found elsewhere.
