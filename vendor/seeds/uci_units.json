                  "body": "<p>The DAC conference series is internationally recognized for its progressive interdisciplinarity, its intellectual rigor and its responsiveness to emerging practices and trends. I am honored to have the opportunity to continue this tradition. My choice of title for this conference: After Media: Embodiment and Context captures a set of issues which I believe are of central concern to contemporary Digital Cultural Practices. After Media questions the value of the term Media Arts - a designation which in my opinion not only erroneously presents the practice as one concerned predominantly with manipulating media, but also leaves the question of what constitutes a medium in this context uninterrogated.</p>\n<p>Embodiment and Context focuses on biological, cultural, geographical and material specificity. Embodiment emphasises the fundamentally embodied nature of our being as the ground-reference for digital practices, and Context emphasises the realities of cultural, historical, geographical and gender-related specificities. Embodiment is deployed not only with respect to the biological, but also with reference to technology, as a corrective to the tendency within computational discourses towards largely uninterrogated Cartesianisms and Platonisms. Such concerns are addressed in contemporary cognitive science, anthropology and other fields which attend to the realities of the physical dimensions of cognition and culture. Context brings together site-specificity of cultural practices, the understandings of situated cognition and practices in locative media. The re-emergence of concerns with such locative and material specificity within the Digital Cultures community is foregrounded in such DAC09 Themes as Software and Platform Studies and Embodiment and Performativity.</p>\n<p>My goal for DAC09 was to create an event which was maximally responsive to the community, was intellectually rigorous and attentive to new trends and new voices. So prior to any call for paper proposals, we organized a call for proposals of Themes, offering the DAC community the opportunity to shape the internal thematics of the event. The Themes chosen for DAC09, around which this Proceedings is organised are: Embodiment and Performativity; After Mobile Media; Software/ Platform Studies; Environment/ Sustainability/ Climate Change; Interdisciplinary Pedagogy; Cognition and Creativity; Sex and Sexuality; Space-Time of Ubiquity and Embeddedness; and Present and Future of Humanist Inquiry in the Digital Field. These themes identify key concerns contemporary practice and theory in Digital Cultures. Along with exploring dimensions of each of these Themes, the papers submitted to the Themes exhibit interesting crossovers between themes and some meta-themes emerge  including a preoccupation with design and a concern with interdisciplinary historicisation and the development of relevant historiographical methods. The conference structure includes morning plenary sessions which have been designed to introduce the various themes and to draw out emergent meta-themes.</p>\n<p>Administratively, I aspired to a flat, distributed and horizontal structure which leveraged web based automation and supported anonymous peer review. We built an ambitious online automated peer review process for two successive review processes. 400 paper proposals were reviewed, and from these, around 150 papers were invited and subject to a similarly rigorous review/editorial process. The efforts of the Theme Leaders:\n                        \tNell Tenhaaf, Melanie Baljko, Kim Sawchuk, Marc Bhlen, Jeremy Douglass, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Andrea Polli, Cynthia Beth Rubin, Nina Czegledy, Fox Harrell, Susanna Paasonen, Jordan Crandall, Ulrik Ekman, Mark Hansen, Terry Harpold, Lisbeth Klastrup, and Susana Tosca; in this process was substantial and in many cases the authors benefited from valuable editorial support, the result of which is demonstrated in this excellent collection.</p>\n<p>Around the conference proceedings proper are situated three specially organized events showcasing various realms of practice relevant to DAC. The Beall Center for Art and Technology offer an exhibition of Artificial Life Art Emergence curated by Simon Penny and David Familian. Michael Dessen and Chris Dobrian organised Latent Potentials, a telematic music performance night, and Mark Marino and Jessica Pressman organised a night of Electronic Literature Performance.</p>\n<p>The DAC events are known for a convivial scale which promotes meaningful exchange in and around the conference venues. I am therefore grateful to Alan Terricicano, Dean of the Claire Trevor Schools of the Arts, for the opportunity to situate the event in the Maya Lin Plaza, which centers the event tightly around Winifred Smith Hall and the Beall Center for Art and Technology, with the Cyberarts caf\u00e9 providing refreshments and a social hub.</p>\n<p>The academic and cultural aspects of DAC09 have depended almost entirely on volunteer labor, bases in Southern California and across the country and the planet. This is itself has involved substantial organisation. Like any such extended and ambitious project, events sometimes did not proceed smoothly. The UC budget crisis, the state, national and global economic downturn certainly has'nt helped matters. More than once, circumstances have conspired against us, in the form of technical breakdowns, external management issues and illness. I am grateful for the patience, goodwill and sheer hard work of my colleagues who have persevered in this project with me. I would particularly like to credit my closest partner in this project, Ward Smith, Information Systems Manager for DAC09, who has managed electronics communications from the outset, including web design and the review and paper submission processes. I have nothing but praise for his intelligence, conscientiousness, decorum and goodwill over two years of collaboration. As new members of the local team in recent months, the effort, acumen and commitment of Elizabeth Losh and Sean Voisen has been invaluable. The DAC09 Event Organisers - David Familian, Michael Dessen, Chris Dobrian, Mark Marino and Jessica Pressman - have enriched the conference with a veritable smorgasboard of cultural events. The work of these people, along with the Theme Leaders have made this conference what it is.</p>\n<p>I am grateful also to several UCI and UC units and to their leaders for their support in times when University resources are sparse: Larry Smarr, Director of CALIT2; G. P. Li, Director of CALIT2 (UCI Division); David Theo Goldberg, Director of the University of California Humanities Research Institute; Susan Bryant, Vice Chancellor for Research UCI, Mark Warner (Associate Vice Chancellor for Administration, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research); Debra Richardson, Dean of the Bren School of Information and Computer Science UCI; Alan Terricciano, Dean, Claire Trevor School of the Arts UCI, and Vicky Ruiz, Dean of the UCI School of Humanities, UCI.\n                        34\tThanks are due also to Bill Cohen and Cassandra Jue Low of the Bren School Information and Computer Science; to Toby Weiner and Jason Valdry of the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, and to many other staff members who have lent support.</p>\n<p>My general goal for DAC09 was to present work of the highest possible intellectual quality and relevance to conference attendees, while drawing our emerging concerns and offering exposure to new voices into the community. This document I feel demonstrates some success in that goal, which attests to the expertise and efforts of all involved.</p>\n<p>Simon Penny,<br> Director, DAC09</p>"

                    "about": "<p> The broader rubric for this theme touches on interaction design as well as the practices of media artists who develop dynamic and/or embodied processes for interactive artworks. The\n                theme carries as well a strong interest in shared agency within the performativity of interaction, such that user and system co-construct interactions. In general, the papers in the\n                theme explore co-constructed experiences across bodies and apparati, and across a mix of realities (for example, across \"first\" and \"second\" life). The theme points to concerns about\n                computation carrying with it values that possibly work against the affective and embodied dimensions of digital media. Thus, several of the papers propose counter-values and\n                counter-aesthetics, for example, by finding meaning in noise, by re-imagining the body/image that inhabits a virtual space, or by exploring forms of embodiment that challenge\n                traditional representational aesthetics of the figure. Papers range from theorizing the audience and its role in actualizing an artwork, to considering the body as shared, rearranged\n                and even immaterial in a technologically-saturated environment, to breaking with preconceptions about how the body is able to perform and which senses afford perception. The range of\n                papers also speaks to how people in the different worlds of digital media - e.g. art, computation, design - can establish conceptual points of contact that enable bridging across\n                domains.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme Leaders</strong>:<br> Nell Tenhaaf, Associate Dean, Faculty of Fine Arts / Associate Professor, Department of Visual Arts York University <a href=\"mailto:tenhaaf@yorku.ca\">tenhaaf@yorku.ca</a>\n                                  <br> Melanie Baljko, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, <a href=\"mailto:mb@cs.yorku.ca\">mb@cs.yorku.ca</a>\n                                  <br>\n                           </p>"

I am honored to have the opportunity to continue this tradition. My choice of title for this conference: After Media: Embodiment and Context captures a set of issues which I believe are of central concern to contemporary Digital Cultural Practices. After Media questions the value of the term Media Arts - a designation which in my opinion not only erroneously presents the practice as one concerned predominantly with manipulating media, but also leaves the question of what constitutes a medium in this context uninterrogated.</p>\n<p>Embodiment and Context focuses on biological, cultural, geographical and material specificity. Embodiment emphasises the fundamentally embodied nature of our being as the ground-reference for digital practices, and Context emphasises the realities of cultural, historical, geographical and gender-related specificities. Embodiment is deployed not only with respect to the biological, but also with reference to technology, as a corrective to the tendency within computational discourses towards largely uninterrogated Cartesianisms and Platonisms. Such concerns are addressed in contemporary cognitive science, anthropology and other fields which attend to the realities of the physical dimensions of cognition and culture. Context brings together site-specificity of cultural practices, the understandings of situated cognition and practices in locative media. The re-emergence of concerns with such locative and material specificity within the Digital Cultures community is foregrounded in such DAC09 Themes as Software and Platform Studies and Embodiment and Performativity.</p>\n<p>My goal for DAC09 was to create an event which was maximally responsive to the community, was intellectually rigorous and attentive to new trends and new voices. So prior to any call for paper proposals, we organized a call for proposals of Themes, offering the DAC community the opportunity to shape the internal thematics of the event. The Themes chosen for DAC09, around which this Proceedings is organised are: Embodiment and Performativity; After Mobile Media; Software/ Platform Studies; Environment/ Sustainability/ Climate Change; Interdisciplinary Pedagogy; Cognition and Creativity; Sex and Sexuality; Space-Time of Ubiquity and Embeddedness; and Present and Future of Humanist Inquiry in the Digital Field. These themes identify key concerns contemporary practice and theory in Digital Cultures. Along with exploring dimensions of each of these Themes, the papers submitted to the Themes exhibit interesting crossovers between themes and some meta-themes emerge  including a preoccupation with design and a concern with interdisciplinary historicisation and the development of relevant historiographical methods. The conference structure includes morning plenary sessions which have been designed to introduce the various themes and to draw out emergent meta-themes.</p>\n<p>Administratively, I aspired to a flat, distributed and horizontal structure which leveraged web based automation and supported anonymous peer review. We built an ambitious online automated peer review process for two successive review processes. 400 paper proposals were reviewed, and from these, around 150 papers were invited and subject to a similarly rigorous review/editorial process. The efforts of the Theme Leaders:\n                        \tNell Tenhaaf, Melanie Baljko, Kim Sawchuk, Marc Bhlen, Jeremy Douglass, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Andrea Polli, Cynthia Beth Rubin, Nina Czegledy, Fox Harrell, Susanna Paasonen, Jordan Crandall, Ulrik Ekman, Mark Hansen, Terry Harpold, Lisbeth Klastrup, and Susana Tosca; in this process was substantial and in many cases the authors benefited from valuable editorial support, the result of which is demonstrated in this excellent collection.</p>\n<p>Around the conference proceedings proper are situated three specially organized events showcasing various realms of practice relevant to DAC. The Beall Center for Art and Technology offer an exhibition of Artificial Life Art Emergence curated by Simon Penny and David Familian. Michael Dessen and Chris Dobrian organised Latent Potentials, a telematic music performance night, and Mark Marino and Jessica Pressman organised a night of Electronic Literature Performance.</p>\n<p>The DAC events are known for a convivial scale which promotes meaningful exchange in and around the conference venues. I am therefore grateful to Alan Terricicano, Dean of the Claire Trevor Schools of the Arts, for the opportunity to situate the event in the Maya Lin Plaza, which centers the event tightly around Winifred Smith Hall and the Beall Center for Art and Technology, with the Cyberarts caf\u00e9 providing refreshments and a social hub.</p>\n<p>The academic and cultural aspects of DAC09 have depended almost entirely on volunteer labor, bases in Southern California and across the country and the planet.

More than once, circumstances have conspired against us, in the form of technical breakdowns, external management issues and illness. I am grateful for the patience, goodwill and sheer hard work of my colleagues who have persevered in this project with me. I would particularly like to credit my closest partner in this project, Ward Smith, Information Systems Manager for DAC09, who has managed electronics communications from the outset, including web design and the review and paper submission processes. I have nothing but praise for his intelligence, conscientiousness, decorum and goodwill over two years of collaboration. As new members of the local team in recent months, the effort, acumen and commitment of Elizabeth Losh and Sean Voisen has been invaluable.

I am honored to have the opportunity to continue this tradition. My choice of title for this conference: After Media: Embodiment and Context captures a set of issues which I believe are of central concern to contemporary Digital Cultural Practices. After Media questions the value of the term Media Arts - a designation which in my opinion not only erroneously presents the practice as one concerned predominantly with manipulating media, but also leaves the question of what constitutes a medium in this context uninterrogated.</p>\n<p>Embodiment and Context focuses on biological, cultural, geographical and material specificity. Embodiment emphasises the fundamentally embodied nature of our being as the ground-reference for digital practices, and Context emphasises the realities of cultural, historical, geographical and gender-related specificities. Embodiment is deployed not only with respect to the biological, but also with reference to technology, as a corrective to the tendency within computational discourses towards largely uninterrogated Cartesianisms and Platonisms. Such concerns are addressed in contemporary cognitive science, anthropology and other fields which attend to the realities of the physical dimensions of cognition and culture. Context brings together site-specificity of cultural practices, the understandings of situated cognition and practices in locative media. The re-emergence of concerns with such locative and material specificity within the Digital Cultures community is foregrounded in such DAC09 Themes as Software and Platform Studies and Embodiment and Performativity.</p>\n<p>My goal for DAC09 was to create an event which was maximally responsive to the community, was intellectually rigorous and attentive to new trends and new voices. So prior to any call for paper proposals, we organized a call for proposals of Themes, offering the DAC community the opportunity to shape the internal thematics of the event. The Themes chosen for DAC09, around which this Proceedings is organised are: Embodiment and Performativity; After Mobile Media; Software/ Platform Studies; Environment/ Sustainability/ Climate Change; Interdisciplinary Pedagogy; Cognition and Creativity; Sex and Sexuality; Space-Time of Ubiquity and Embeddedness; and Present and Future of Humanist Inquiry in the Digital Field. These themes identify key concerns contemporary practice and theory in Digital Cultures. Along with exploring dimensions of each of these Themes, the papers submitted to the Themes exhibit interesting crossovers between themes and some meta-themes emerge  including a preoccupation with design and a concern with interdisciplinary historicisation and the development of relevant historiographical methods. The conference structure includes morning plenary sessions which have been designed to introduce the various themes and to draw out emergent meta-themes.</p>\n<p>Administratively, I aspired to a flat, distributed and horizontal structure which leveraged web based automation and supported anonymous peer review. We built an ambitious online automated peer review process for two successive review processes. 400 paper proposals were reviewed, and from these, around 150 papers were invited and subject to a similarly rigorous review/editorial process. The efforts of the Theme Leaders:\n                        \tNell Tenhaaf, Melanie Baljko, Kim Sawchuk, Marc Bhlen, Jeremy Douglass, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Andrea Polli, Cynthia Beth Rubin, Nina Czegledy, Fox Harrell, Susanna Paasonen, Jordan Crandall, Ulrik Ekman, Mark Hansen, Terry Harpold, Lisbeth Klastrup, and Susana Tosca; in this process was substantial and in many cases the authors benefited from valuable editorial support, the result of which is demonstrated in this excellent collection.</p>\n<p>Around the conference proceedings proper are situated three specially organized events showcasing various realms of practice relevant to DAC. The Beall Center for Art and Technology offer an exhibition of Artificial Life Art Emergence curated by Simon Penny and David Familian. Michael Dessen and Chris Dobrian organised Latent Potentials, a telematic music performance night, and Mark Marino and Jessica Pressman organised a night of Electronic Literature Performance.</p>\n<p>The DAC events are known for a convivial scale which promotes meaningful exchange in and around the conference venues. I am therefore grateful to Alan Terricicano, Dean of the Claire Trevor Schools of the Arts, for the opportunity to situate the event in the Maya Lin Plaza, which centers the event tightly around Winifred Smith Hall and the Beall Center for Art and Technology, with the Cyberarts caf\u00e9 providing refreshments and a social hub.</p>\n<p>The academic and cultural aspects of DAC09 have depended almost entirely on volunteer labor, bases in Southern California and across the country and the planet. This is itself has involved substantial organisation. Like any such extended and ambitious project, events sometimes did not proceed smoothly. The UC budget crisis, the state, national and global economic downturn certainly has'nt helped matters. More than once, circumstances have conspired against us, in the form of technical breakdowns, external management issues and illness. I am grateful for the patience, goodwill and sheer hard work of my colleagues who have persevered in this project with me. I would particularly like to credit my closest partner in this project, Ward Smith, Information Systems Manager for DAC09, who has managed electronics communications from the outset, including web design and the review and paper submission processes. I have nothing but praise for his intelligence, conscientiousness, decorum and goodwill over two years of collaboration. As new members of the local team in recent months, the effort, acumen and commitment of Elizabeth Losh and Sean Voisen has been invaluable. The DAC09 Event Organisers - David Familian, Michael Dessen, Chris Dobrian, Mark Marino and Jessica Pressman - have enriched the conference with a veritable smorgasboard of cultural events.

                    "about": "<p>Cross-disciplinary tactics are deeply embedded in contemporary culture, yet interdisciplinary pedagogy remains a problematic issue. While key disciplines are brought together in digital\n                arts education, a gap exists between theory and cross-disciplinary practice, between formal education scenarios at academic institutions and the application of rapidly developing media\n                technologies. Critical investigation focused on interdisciplinary pedagogy is a fundamental undertaking for the clarification of the existing situation and strategy development for the\n                future. The panel is designed for academics and digital artists who wish to explore discourses, methodologies and philosophies associated with interdisciplinary approaches as they are\n                applied to pedagogy. There are questions to be explored such as: What are some of the classes being taught in digital culture programs and what would we like to see? How do we\n                understand the spectrum of different kinds of new media (or digital) art today? The panel provides a platform for interdisciplinary pedagogy including investigations through reference\n                to collaborative work between artists and scientists and critical writing on arts/science projects and research. The primary aim of the educational panel is to address the disparity of\n                various tendencies, showcase interdisciplinary and hybrid solutions and provoke a sustainable dialogue on contemporary educational issues between the practitioners in this field.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme Leaders</strong>:<br> Cynthia Beth Rubin: <a href=\"mailto:cbr@cbrubin.net\">cbr@cbrubin.net</a>\n                                  <br> Nina Czegledy: <a href=\"mailto:czegledy@interlog.com\">czegledy@interlog.com</a>\n                           </p>"

This involves the ways in which digital\n                media shapes and channels sexual desires and identifications, as well as the kinds of sexual dynamics that become attached to encounters with and through media technologies. Rather\n                than being approached as mere instruments for exploring identities, sexualities, or desires, digital media is understood as facilitating certain kinds of interactions between people,\n                technologies, representations, and platforms -- giving rise to new kinds of affective intensities, sociabilities, and networked experiences.</p>\n<p> The topics presented under the theme include gender, desire and identity in virtual worlds; epistemologies of transition; queer sexuality, aesthetics, and sexual politics;\n                international pornography and cultural identity; biopower, knowledge production, and sexual practice; fetishes and fantasies of mechanicity; and sensuous intimacies with new\n                technologies. This range of topics and approaches makes evident the complexity of issues categorized under the deceptively simple terms sex and sexuality. Unpacking these terms and\n                their associations, the presentations in \"Sex and Sexuality\" open up new spaces for thinking about sexuality and technology beyond binary concepts like embodiment and disembodiment,\n                the factual and the virtual, or the offline and the online -- revealing forms of mediated intimacy, sensuous intensity, and connective presence.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme Leaders</strong>: <br> Susanna Paasonen, research fellow<br> Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies<br>\n                                  <a href=\"mailto:spaasone@mappi.helsinki.fi\">spaasone@mappi.helsinki.fi</a>\n                                  <br>Jordan Crandall: <a href=\"mailto:actor@jordancrandall.com\">actor@jordancrandall.com</a>\n                           </p>"

                    "about": "<p> Software is a layer of control and communication that permeates contemporary culture: the engine that drives cyberculture, new media, games, and digital art, as well as the work of\n                businesses and militaries, typesetters and DJs. Platforms are the layers of hardware and software relationships that enable and constrain software expressions. Software studies and\n                platform studies are related interdisciplinary fields of research that approach these topics both as technical artifacts and from the perspectives of the social sciences, humanities,\n                and arts. What are the histories, cultures, and aesthetics of software and platforms? More specifically, for the papers collected here, to investigate the logics of visualization,\n                simulation, and representation in contemporary digital arts and culture is to engage in software and platform studies.</p>\n<p> Critical engagements with software and platforms are always interrelated, although the emphasis can change significantly. Platform studies sometimes situates itself within a \"levels\"\n                model of new media, in which the lowest level, platform, underpins code, form/function, interface, and reception/operation. The platform exerts creative constraint on the levels it\n                supports through design specification. Consequently, platform studies investigates the relationships between the hardware and software design of computing systems and the creative\n                works produced on those systems. These investigations can be bottom up or top down, running from the history of a specification to the consequences for enabled productions, or from a\n                particular digital work back down to the platform that provides context and constraint for its unique implementation.</p>\n<p> Software studies investigates the interrelated questions of how software is implicated in culture at the macro-level and how software signifies at the micro-level. Different\n                investigations have emphasized the data, execution, or source code aspects of software. The Cultural Analytics research agenda asks how software society (big data, network culture,\n                etc.) functions as a whole, and seeks answers to large-scale cultural questions through the application of data-driven methodologies such as exploration, mining, and visualization.\n                Expressive Processing investigates what specific software processes express, both in the concepts embodied in their designs and in the intellectual histories of their algorithms.\n                Critical Code Studies emphasizes how those articulations are made and circulate in their pre-compiled state: the aesthetics of the programmer and the significance of the keyword or the\n                comment.</p>\n<p>Current approaches to software studies and platform studies are richly varied in their different initial emphases, but all tend to lead in to a shared interdisciplinary emphasis on\n                holistic study that brings cultural / historical vantage points to hardware and software, data and execution, production and reception.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme Leaders</strong>:<br> Jeremy Douglass, PhD.

After Media questions the value of the term Media Arts - a designation which in my opinion not only erroneously presents the practice as one concerned predominantly with manipulating media, but also leaves the question of what constitutes a medium in this context uninterrogated.</p>\n<p>Embodiment and Context focuses on biological, cultural, geographical and material specificity. Embodiment emphasises the fundamentally embodied nature of our being as the ground-reference for digital practices, and Context emphasises the realities of cultural, historical, geographical and gender-related specificities. Embodiment is deployed not only with respect to the biological, but also with reference to technology, as a corrective to the tendency within computational discourses towards largely uninterrogated Cartesianisms and Platonisms. Such concerns are addressed in contemporary cognitive science, anthropology and other fields which attend to the realities of the physical dimensions of cognition and culture. Context brings together site-specificity of cultural practices, the understandings of situated cognition and practices in locative media. The re-emergence of concerns with such locative and material specificity within the Digital Cultures community is foregrounded in such DAC09 Themes as Software and Platform Studies and Embodiment and Performativity.</p>\n<p>My goal for DAC09 was to create an event which was maximally responsive to the community, was intellectually rigorous and attentive to new trends and new voices. So prior to any call for paper proposals, we organized a call for proposals of Themes, offering the DAC community the opportunity to shape the internal thematics of the event. The Themes chosen for DAC09, around which this Proceedings is organised are: Embodiment and Performativity; After Mobile Media; Software/ Platform Studies; Environment/ Sustainability/ Climate Change; Interdisciplinary Pedagogy; Cognition and Creativity; Sex and Sexuality; Space-Time of Ubiquity and Embeddedness; and Present and Future of Humanist Inquiry in the Digital Field. These themes identify key concerns contemporary practice and theory in Digital Cultures. Along with exploring dimensions of each of these Themes, the papers submitted to the Themes exhibit interesting crossovers between themes and some meta-themes emerge  including a preoccupation with design and a concern with interdisciplinary historicisation and the development of relevant historiographical methods. The conference structure includes morning plenary sessions which have been designed to introduce the various themes and to draw out emergent meta-themes.</p>\n<p>Administratively, I aspired to a flat, distributed and horizontal structure which leveraged web based automation and supported anonymous peer review. We built an ambitious online automated peer review process for two successive review processes. 400 paper proposals were reviewed, and from these, around 150 papers were invited and subject to a similarly rigorous review/editorial process. The efforts of the Theme Leaders:\n                        \tNell Tenhaaf, Melanie Baljko, Kim Sawchuk, Marc Bhlen, Jeremy Douglass, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Andrea Polli, Cynthia Beth Rubin, Nina Czegledy, Fox Harrell, Susanna Paasonen, Jordan Crandall, Ulrik Ekman, Mark Hansen, Terry Harpold, Lisbeth Klastrup, and Susana Tosca; in this process was substantial and in many cases the authors benefited from valuable editorial support, the result of which is demonstrated in this excellent collection.</p>\n<p>Around the conference proceedings proper are situated three specially organized events showcasing various realms of practice relevant to DAC. The Beall Center for Art and Technology offer an exhibition of Artificial Life Art Emergence curated by Simon Penny and David Familian. Michael Dessen and Chris Dobrian organised Latent Potentials, a telematic music performance night, and Mark Marino and Jessica Pressman organised a night of Electronic Literature Performance.</p>\n<p>The DAC events are known for a convivial scale which promotes meaningful exchange in and around the conference venues. I am therefore grateful to Alan Terricicano, Dean of the Claire Trevor Schools of the Arts, for the opportunity to situate the event in the Maya Lin Plaza, which centers the event tightly around Winifred Smith Hall and the Beall Center for Art and Technology, with the Cyberarts caf\u00e9 providing refreshments and a social hub.</p>\n<p>The academic and cultural aspects of DAC09 have depended almost entirely on volunteer labor, bases in Southern California and across the country and the planet. This is itself has involved substantial organisation. Like any such extended and ambitious project, events sometimes did not proceed smoothly. The UC budget crisis, the state, national and global economic downturn certainly has'nt helped matters. More than once, circumstances have conspired against us, in the form of technical breakdowns, external management issues and illness. I am grateful for the patience, goodwill and sheer hard work of my colleagues who have persevered in this project with me. I would particularly like to credit my closest partner in this project, Ward Smith, Information Systems Manager for DAC09, who has managed electronics communications from the outset, including web design and the review and paper submission processes. I have nothing but praise for his intelligence, conscientiousness, decorum and goodwill over two years of collaboration. As new members of the local team in recent months, the effort, acumen and commitment of Elizabeth Losh and Sean Voisen has been invaluable. The DAC09 Event Organisers - David Familian, Michael Dessen, Chris Dobrian, Mark Marino and Jessica Pressman - have enriched the conference with a veritable smorgasboard of cultural events. The work of these people, along with the Theme Leaders have made this conference what it is.</p>\n<p>I am grateful also to several UCI and UC units and to their leaders for their support in times when University resources are sparse: Larry Smarr, Director of CALIT2; G. P. Li, Director of CALIT2 (UCI Division); David Theo Goldberg, Director of the University of California Humanities Research Institute; Susan Bryant, Vice Chancellor for Research UCI, Mark Warner (Associate Vice Chancellor for Administration, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research); Debra Richardson, Dean of the Bren School of Information and Computer Science UCI; Alan Terricciano, Dean, Claire Trevor School of the Arts UCI, and Vicky Ruiz, Dean of the UCI School of Humanities, UCI.\n                        34\tThanks are due also to Bill Cohen and Cassandra Jue Low of the Bren School Information and Computer Science; to Toby Weiner and Jason Valdry of the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, and to many other staff members who have lent support.</p>\n<p>My general goal for DAC09 was to present work of the highest possible intellectual quality and relevance to conference attendees, while drawing our emerging concerns and offering exposure to new voices into the community. This document I feel demonstrates some success in that goal, which attests to the expertise and efforts of all involved.</p>\n<p>Simon Penny,<br> Director, DAC09</p>"

              "body": "UC Irvine\u2019s Humanities Honors Program nurtures the intellectual lives of top undergraduates in the School of Humanities.  Embracing values of curiosity, critical inquiry, creativity, and collaboration, this two-year program builds multilogues across  disciplines  through a year-long series of interdisciplinary seminars followed by a year of independent work culminating in a senior thesis.  Work on the thesis, though typically mounted within a single field, is developed through formal conversation and exchange with other students who might be tilling very different fields.   Critical theory, one of UC Irvine\u2019s traditional strengths, often provides a common language across very different projects.  Thesis writers read and respond to one another\u2019s writing throughout the year while also reflecting on the purpose behind their own work.  Thus each individual thesis is shaped in a dynamic and multi\u2014dimensional environment of critical inquiry that in itself speaks to the ongoing value and relevance of the humanities.as it fosters values crucial  to modern democracy:  empathy, imagination, critical debate, and balance between active self-reflection and opening outwards  into the world of others.  Written under the direction of  generous, committed faculty in the School of Humanities, the theses published on this site embody these values even as they make original contributions to urgent conversations currently unfolding in the academy and  beyond. <a href=\"https://www.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/opportunities/honors.php\">https://www.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/opportunities/honors.php</a>"

To carry out its mission, the UC LMRI funded research of UC faculty and graduate students; provided professional development for researchers, educators, and policymakers; and disseminated information to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers on educational issues affecting linguistic minorities as well as racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants for both California and the nation. </p>\n<p> As a part of its dissemination activities it sponsored an annual research conference that drew participants from across the nation, and conducted regular policy seminars in the state capitol to inform policymakers on the latest research relevant to pending policy issues. The policy seminars became a notable fixture in the capitol. UC LMRI produced dozens of reports, several books, and was the catalyst for numerous journal articles during its existence. It was the \u201cgo to\u201d research center on issues of English language learners for both researchers and practitioners nationwide. Some of the most consulted publications produced over the years are available here at the Civil Rights Project website. </p>\n<p>  The UC LMRI closed its doors in 2009 after 25 years of existence. In order to make its documents available, LMRI documents are housed here.</p>"

Recognizing that the medical humanities was pursued at multiple UC medical schools and health science centers, faculty directors from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and UCSF can now support collaborative student research projects, publications, and resources for courses and public events.</p>\n<p>Our aim is to have a substantial record of achievement and innovation in particular themes that we collectively pursue through our allocated research funding at the end of our five year grant period. We then hope to expand our efforts to include faculty and students at the remaining UC health science centers to promote an even more rigorous and representative approach to supporting humanism in medicine and health science education.</p>"

The Department fosters a critical empiricism that employs a range of ethnographic, historical, and quantitative methods to address questions of subjectivity, political economy, and social inequality. The department has become recognized as one of the top anthropology programs for graduate work in the United States. It is the second largest sociocultural program in the University of California system and among the twelve largest nationally. Between 2000 and 2006, the department ranked first in placing research articles in the top three academic journals in anthropology. In 2006, the Center for a Public Anthropology ranked the department eighth nationally in disseminating its research to a broader audience. Since 1998, the department has received continuous graduate student and faculty research funding from the National Science Foundation and other extramural agencies.</p>"

ANTswers is a web-based application, run on a remote library server and is accessed through a web interface page.  ANTswers\u2019 personality and persona is based on the UCI mascot, Peter the Anteater.  ANTswers responds to simple and short questions.  The first link in a response opens in a preview window, all other links open in a new window.</p>\n<p>This collection includes approximately 130 .aiml files that are available for download and for the use in creating other library chatbots.  To implement your own library chatbot you will need a server, chatbot software (we used Program-O), editing software (we used Notepad++) and at least minimal experience with HRML, CSS, Javascript and AIML.  ANTswers is built for an academic library with 2 main libraries, a study center, special collections and archives, and a law and medical library.  You will need to review and edit each of the files for your particular institution.</p>"

Rorty was a pragmatist philosopher, critical theorist, and public intellectual who is commonly described as one of the most important thinkers of his era. In addition to almost 25 linear feet of papers, the Richard Rorty Archive also include over 1,000 born-digital word processing files that were preserved from Rorty's floppy disks in <a href=\"http://ucispace.lib.uci.edu/handle/10575/7\">UCIspace @ the Libraries</a>.</p>\n<p>Participants in the <a href=\"http://virtualpolitik.org/rorty/\">Time Will Tell, But Epistemology Won't</a> symposium addressed a number of key questions for criticism in the era of computational media. What is an archive if it includes \u201cborn digital\u201d materials? How do new forms of digital production and reception change the character of scholarly discourse? What is the relationship between public memory and computer memory? How should teaching materials be handled in the age of open courseware? How can Rorty\u2019s ideas about philosophy as cultural politics be read in both the liberal and the academic blogospheres? How can more dialogue between critical theory and the digital humanities be fostered?</p>\n<p>The symposium was sponsored by the UC Irvine Libraries, the UC Irvine Humanities Center, the UC Irvine Critical Theory Emphasis, the UC Irvine Department of Philosophy, the UC Irvine Department of Comparative Literature, the Office of the Campus Writing Coordinator, and the systemwide University of California Humanities Research Institute.</p>\n<p>Speakers included Elizabeth Losh (UC Irvine), David Theo Goldberg (UC Irvine), Mary Rorty, (Stanford), Michelle Light (UC Irvine), Dawn Schmitz (UC Irvine), Erin Obodiac (UC Irvine), Tom Hyry (UCLA), Christine Borgman (UCLA),  Iain Thomson (University of New Mexico), Mark Wrathall (UC Riverside), Margaret Gilbert (UC Irvine), Ian Bogost (Georgia Tech), Steven Mailloux (Loyola Marymount), Ali M.

Rorty was a pragmatist philosopher, critical theorist, and public intellectual who is commonly described as one of the most important thinkers of his era. In addition to almost 25 linear feet of papers, the Richard Rorty Archive also include over 1,000 born-digital word processing files that were preserved from Rorty's floppy disks in <a href=\"http://ucispace.lib.uci.edu/handle/10575/7\">UCIspace @ the Libraries</a>.</p>\n<p>Participants in the <a href=\"http://virtualpolitik.org/rorty/\">Time Will Tell, But Epistemology Won't</a> symposium addressed a number of key questions for criticism in the era of computational media. What is an archive if it includes \u201cborn digital\u201d materials? How do new forms of digital production and reception change the character of scholarly discourse? What is the relationship between public memory and computer memory? How should teaching materials be handled in the age of open courseware? How can Rorty\u2019s ideas about philosophy as cultural politics be read in both the liberal and the academic blogospheres? How can more dialogue between critical theory and the digital humanities be fostered?</p>\n<p>The symposium was sponsored by the UC Irvine Libraries, the UC Irvine Humanities Center, the UC Irvine Critical Theory Emphasis, the UC Irvine Department of Philosophy, the UC Irvine Department of Comparative Literature, the Office of the Campus Writing Coordinator, and the systemwide University of California Humanities Research Institute.</p>\n<p>Speakers included Elizabeth Losh (UC Irvine), David Theo Goldberg (UC Irvine), Mary Rorty, (Stanford), Michelle Light (UC Irvine), Dawn Schmitz (UC Irvine), Erin Obodiac (UC Irvine), Tom Hyry (UCLA), Christine Borgman (UCLA),  Iain Thomson (University of New Mexico), Mark Wrathall (UC Riverside), Margaret Gilbert (UC Irvine), Ian Bogost (Georgia Tech), Steven Mailloux (Loyola Marymount), Ali M.
